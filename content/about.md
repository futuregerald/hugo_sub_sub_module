I build websites from and occasionally [**for**](/project_tags/mtl/) Montréal 🇨🇦.

My name is mentioned in the <span class="desktop-inline">sidebar (twice)</span><span class="mobile-inline tablet-inline">header (biggly)</span>, I've been in the business since 2010 and I have this <a target="_blank" class="no-ajax" rel="nofollow" href="https://regisphilibert.com/2011/">old thing</a> to prove it.

I specialise in [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/)[^1]  I can't stop writing about [here](/tags/hugo) and Wordpress

I am __front end__ first and foremost, the view is what I love best. That being said, yeah, I do __back end__ as well.

My most outstanding works are listed [here](/).

I'm on <span class="black-color">{{% a_blank "__GitHub__" "https://github.com/regisphilibert" %}}</span>, <span class="twitter-color">{{% a_blank "🐦__Twitter__" "https://twitter.com/regisphilibert" %}}</span> and <span class="black-color">{{% a_blank "__LinkedIn__🚾" "https://www.linkedin.com/in/regisphilibert" %}}[^2]</span>, 

As many of my clients I'm afraid no one sees what's below the fold. Have you seen the skill grid below ? Down there, one or two scroll away.

[^1]: I would never, in my wildest dream, imply that LinkedIn is toilet, it's just the [emoji](https://emojipedia.org/water-closet/) closer to their logo.

[^2]: Yes this website is built with Hugo.
